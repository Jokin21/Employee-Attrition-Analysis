# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
 Employee Attrition Analysis in Tableau

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition data and identify key factors that contribute to employee turnover. The analysis aims to provide insights into employee behavior and preferences, as well as potential areas for improvement, in order to inform HR and management decisions.

Dataset:
The dataset contains rows and columns, with information on [list key variables, e.g. employee demographics, job role, performance metrics]. The dataset spans [time period or date range, e.g. 2017-2019], and includes data from [list sources, e.g. HR records, employee surveys].

Methodology:
The analysis will involve several steps, including:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: This will involve identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
Descriptive statistics: This will involve calculating summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for key variables in the dataset.
Data visualization: This will involve creating various visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatterplots, to explore relationships between variables and identify trends and patterns.
Cohort analysis: This will involve analyzing attrition rates by employee cohort, such as by job role or hire date, to identify potential factors that contribute to turnover.
Predictive modeling: This will involve building predictive models, such as logistic regression or decision trees, to identify key predictors of attrition and potential interventions to mitigate employee turnover.
Expected Outcomes:
The analysis is expected to provide insights into employee behavior and preferences, such as:

Which job roles have the highest attrition rates?
Are there differences in attrition rates by demographic factors, such as age or gender?
Are there common patterns or trends in employee turnover that suggest underlying issues or opportunities for improvement?
These insights can then be used to inform HR and management decisions, such as:

Identifying potential interventions, such as improving onboarding or increasing opportunities for professional development, to retain employees.
Developing targeted retention strategies for specific employee cohorts.
Optimizing workforce planning and resource allocation to mitigate the impact of employee turnover.
Deliverables:
The deliverables for this project will include:

A report summarizing the findings of the analysis, including key insights and recommendations for future HR and management decisions.
Visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to support the findings in the report.
Cleaned and preprocessed data that can be used for further analysis or modeling.
A Tableau dashboard that allows users to explore the data and interact with the visualizations.
